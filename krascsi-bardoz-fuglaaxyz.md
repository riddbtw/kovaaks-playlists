Your main problem is putting your crosshair back on the bot after it blinks.



* There’s that mechanic in static, which you absolutely abuse. This comes from the low ttk aspect of static. As you know, in static, you only need 1 click to kill 1 target. Speed matters, accuracy matters, lowering time between going from 1 target to another matters. You solved this last part I just mentioned by abusing/perfecting a technique. This technique is the “initial flick” + micro-correction. If you do that you don’t have to do perfect flicks on the first time and confirm if you’re on target. You save time by doing this, and the faster you can make the “initial flick” and the micro-correction, the better you are at static. On the other hand, if you do everything perfectly, it’s slow AND inefficient.
* BUT. There’s a big BUT there. Tracking doesn’t work like that. When you track 1 invincible target, it has infinite HP. Your goal is to maximize your damage during that minute. How do you do that optimally? You are smooth, reactive, you flick perfectly back on to the target for the first time. You see what I did there? At moments when you lost the bot, it was because you had to use that last resort static technique, resulting in losing free damage. In tracking if your initial flick is perfect, neither over nor underflicking, you maximize damage output. You do that because you have a dps weapon which deals damage over time, so you want your crosshair to be on the target as much as possible.

Another, but less visible problem of yours is that when the bot just ADAD strafes.



* When this happens, you don’t always put your crosshair on the right part of the bot. As you might already know, strafing is abusable if not done right in any game. Kovaak’s is not different. This is why rallex was accused of cheating by vF, because he abused this in his AIR runs. It’s called edge tracking. When the bot does short strafes, you can get free damage in without always reacting to its movement perfectly. This is done also to maximize damage, to be more efficient. If a bot is doing short strafes from left to right, right to left, there is a point, in between the bot’s dodge’s 2 end points, which, without even moving your crosshair it will be on the bot for the longest time possible. This can be seen in Quake/AFPS Duels mostly, where it’s literally impossible to track each and every dodge. All the good Kovaak trackers know this, and they abuse it.
* You don’t have to always aim perfectly at the middle of the bot. After playing the scenario multiple times, you can kind of predict its dodge, especially if it’s near the walls/floor. When this happens the bot has restricted movement, which theoretically makes tracking it easier.

The least problem is with your mouse control, smoothness and/or reactivity.



* As you already know most good Kovaak trackers abuse smoothness, because it maximizes damage combined with edge-tracking and a basic level of reactivity. The thing is, being smooth not only helps tracking because of maximizing damage, it also helps with reading the bot. If you’re shaky with your crosshair, you have more relative movement(between your eyes, crosshair and target), than if you weren’t. It just makes sense.
    * It’s nothing groundbreaking, and I wouldn’t issue this by giving you useless smoothness scens. I’ll try to keep your practice as efficient as possible.

**The routine:**

Each and every scenario will have a description of why and how to play it, just like in your Valorant routine.

**Fundamental:**

_XY 3D Tracking:_



* Good warmup and it helps to get a feel of some weird angles.
* It’s an easy and casual scenario which speaks for itself. Just track the bot and try to find solutions if you have uncomfortable angles.

_ddtv xyz mid fast small:_



* Good practice/warmup for the start of a FuglaaXYZ run, literally nothing else. Maybe good warmup

_FuglaaXYZ Voltaic Easy:_



* An easy version is always good to get used to the real deal.
    * It’s only a speculation and it’s purely anecdotal, but it seems like the hitsounds actually help. You get used to what you hear on the Easy version, which you can later recreate on the normal version.
* It’s a toned down version of FuglaaXYZ, which means that you can practice the “perfect initial flick”, edge tracking on strafes, you can get a feel of the pattern, and it even helps you learn the smoothness needed for the scen.

_fuglaaXYShortstrafes:_



* 2D version of FuglaaXYZ basically, with a worse dodge pattern, but perfect to get a feel for not reacting to 100% of the bot’s movement and trying to abuse its dodge pattern.

_fuglaaXYShortstrafes OW:_



* Its purpose is the same as its original version(above), but more reactive because the bot has instant acceleration.

_fuglaaXYReactivity V2:_



* A 2D map, the bot blinks, but after the blink it either does short strafes (try this edge-tracking thing, more efficient crosshair placement) or long strafes (be smooth on those).

_fuglaaXY Reactive rAim:_



* An rA benchmark, which is actually not bad practice. It’s just like the previous scenario, with a bit more variety. React to the blinks, try to perfect that initial flick.

_fuglaaXYKillimanjaro V2:_



* It’s still the same category, but the bot movement is a bit more horizontalish, and does longer strafes more often. Try to flick in 1 movement when the bot blinks.

_FuglaaXYZ Smooth Beta:_



* This scenario is basically a mix of FuglaaXYZ Voltaic and Air Angelic 4 Voltaic. Basically the way to practice a bit of smoothness and weird angles.

_FuglaaXYZ Voltaic No Blinks small:_



* This might sound weird, I mean, No blinks in a scen which is reactive. But it actually helps a lot. It helps you learn the bot’s strafe pattern, how to track it efficiently by going for highscores. Other good FuglaaXYZ players also abused this scen.

_FuglaaXYZ Voltaic No Blinks:_



* The normal sized version of the scenario above, serves the same purpose. After tracking a small target, tracking the normal sized one might feel easier. You should focus on the same thing, just tracking the strafes while getting used to the pattern.

_FuglaaXYZ Voltaic:_



* The benchmark itself we wanted to improve on. All I can say is not to forget the things you’ve focused on the scenarios above, but don’t think too much into my descriptions when playing THIS scenario, and this scenario only. You want to use your knowledge.
* You might take another approach, which is practicing whichever aspect of the 3 I mentioned at the start you want to improve at, but as far as I know you like to go straight in, so I recommend the method above.

**Extra Scenarios:**

All of the scenarios in this playlist are just to give you more variation, in the case you get bored of the fundamental one. These are still very useful, but you asked me to keep the routine short.

**End notes:**



* Use a small crosshair, so you can see your mistakes easier.
* Play the fundamental one at least once a day.
* You can share this on stream, it won’t bother me, just credit me.
* If you don’t understand anything, just dm me.
* As far as I know your sensitivity choices are reasonable, so I won’t give any sorts of guidelines concerning that.
