# kovaaks-playlists
Collection of playlists for Kovaaks.  These are all the playlists that I've found through discord, twitter, youtube, and other avenues all consolidated into one place.  

These playlists are divided into the following groups:
* Benches - these are the Revosect and Voltaic benchmarks
* Beginner routines - routines specifically for beginners
* Game-specific - routines meant to help with specific games
* Legacy - older routines (1+ years old) for reference
* New - anything that doesn't fit into the other categories
* Recommended - the original list of routines I recommended from my [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/5D5au2nWTnA)

# how to use these playlists
1. Grab the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/riddbtw/kovaaks-plos/releases) and unzip the files
2. Copy the JSON files to your Kovaaks playlist directory:

**\path\to\Steam\steamapps\common\FPSAimTrainer\FPSAimTrainer\Saved\SaveGames\Playlists**

3. Next time you start up Kovaaks you will see them available in your Local Playlists

* [Pasu 1b1](https://github.com/riddbtw/kovaaks-playlists/tree/main/routines-recommended/pasu_1by1.json) - not many moving dots specific routines out there, this is the best I've found
